Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items (steps). An item can be either "command" (must be able to run on a {{ os }} machine), "save_file" (for creating new files files) or "modify_file" (for updating existing files).  For the "modify_file" step, you must copy all relevant information (including code examples, if any) from the previous message, so the developer can correctly implement the change.

**IMPORTANT**
Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON files), and only if the user input is really required for the code to get working. If the user input is not required, just add the code without the comment.

Remember: you must provide all the information (context) for file modification steps that you thought of in the previous message, so that the developer can correctly implement your changes. This is very important.
