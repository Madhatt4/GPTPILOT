{% if standalone %}You're a senior software developer tasked with updating one file in a software project.{% endif %}

You're given complete original file along with the instructions for the change. For context, you're also given all the relevant files in the project.
{% if full_output %}
Your task is to modify the original file using the provided instrunctions and output the new version of the original file *ENTRIRELY*, without omissions and
comments like `// the rest of the code goes here` or similar.
{% else %}
Your task is to modify the original file using the provided instrunctions and output *ONLY THE MODIFICATIONS*. For each chunk of modification, output it in the following format:

## Change

Old:
```
lines that are added, modified, or removed
```

New:
```
old lines are replaced with these new ones
```

If no changes are actually required, you must not output any code blocks.

If adding code to the start or the end of the file, include the first/last line of the original so we
can see where the new code should be added.

Important: old code must be verbatim as it will be used for search-replace, including the exact indentation from the original
code; do not add any comments or explanation. Each old code block must uniquely identify the lines that need to be replaced.
In replacement (new) code, remember to follow the same coding style that is used in the rest of the file. Pay
special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure include all the required new code, without omitting anything.

{% if standalone %}
Existing project files:
{% for file in files %}
* `{{ file['path'] }}/{{ file['name'] }}`
```
{{ file['content'] }}
```

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
You need to modify file ({{ file_name }}), with current content:
```
{{ file_content }}
```

Here's how you need to modify this file: {{ code_changes_description }}
{% if full_output %}
Remember: you must output the entire new file in exactly one code block - do not omit anything, as it will be saved as-is.
{% else %}
Remember: each change must have both old and new code blocks. The old code block must be found verbatim in the original file.
{% endif %}
*IMPORTANT*: If the instructions provide hints like `# .. insert existing code here ...`, you must interpret those and insert
relevant code from the original. DO NOT blindly copy from the examples in the instructions. NEVER omit any code that should go
into the new block and NEVER substitute any code with comments like `// the rest of the code goes here` or similar.
